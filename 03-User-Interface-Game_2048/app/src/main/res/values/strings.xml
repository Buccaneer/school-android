    <string name="text_about">This game features a 4x4 grid of tiles with a numeric value which are powers of two.\n\nYou can swipe all the tiles in one of four directions at once. When two tiles with the same value collide, they become one tile with their combined value. With every move new tiles are spawned at random.\n\nYour goal is to keep swiping until one tile reaches 2048 or the board fills up and you can\'t move anymore - game over.</string>
